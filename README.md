# Techniques
Mainly made by HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Jquery

# Layout
Try to provide a relatively cyber feel to audience by using slanted boundary.
Small animation is set on website with interaction.

# Difficulties
I originally want to add slide-in animation triggered by scrolling, but hard to control at mobile environment (since using px is not responsive).
